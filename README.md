# iOS_Tetris

This is my first iOS application I have created. I decided to make a Tetris game for my first iOS project, 
Tetris is a nice simple game that has rules to implement and object classes to create.

## How to run the project

This app is not published on the App Store, this is a local project that needs to be run on a macOS Catalina. 
On a macOS system with Catlina installed, install and run XCode 11 and run the project through an iOS device simulator.
